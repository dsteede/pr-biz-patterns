# Business Patterns in Puerto Rico (2013-2023)
Ironhack Data Analysis Project by Danielle Steede and Vanessa Jimenez


## Overview
In this project we aim to analyze data sets of Business Patterns in Puerto Rico from 1998-2022 and answer the following questions:
1. What are the industries that have had the most growth in Puerto Rico over the past 20 years and where are they located? 
2. Which industries have shrunk the most in Puerto Rico over the past 20 years and where are they located?
